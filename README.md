As part of my internship task, I have developed a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator provides users with a versatile tool for performing mathematical calculations with ease.
The HTML structure forms the core of the calculator. It includes a display area to show the input and output of calculations. Additionally, buttons are created to represent numeric values, operators, and other functions such as clear and equals. These buttons are organized in a grid-like layout, making it intuitive for users to input their calculations.

CSS is utilized to style the calculator, enhancing its visual appeal and usability. The design focuses on clarity and simplicity, making it easy for users to identify and interact with the buttons. The use of colors, typography, and layout ensures a pleasant and intuitive user experience.

JavaScript plays a crucial role in the functionality of the calculator. It enables dynamic interaction between the user and the calculator, facilitating real-time calculations. When a button is clicked, JavaScript captures the corresponding value and performs the necessary mathematical operations based on the user's input. The result is then displayed in the calculator's display area.

The integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript results in a powerful and user-friendly calculator. It allows users to perform a wide range of calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. The calculator also includes features such as the ability to clear the input and evaluate complex expressions accurately.

By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have developed an efficient and visually appealing calculator. It provides users with a versatile tool for performing mathematical calculations quickly and accurately. This calculator enhances productivity and convenience, making it an invaluable asset for various tasks requiring mathematical computations.![Task 4 calculator](https://github.com/GordxRohit/Calculator-task-4-lgm/assets/82945265/340bfd1c-b544-4b4b-9e2e-cf7918964ed6)
